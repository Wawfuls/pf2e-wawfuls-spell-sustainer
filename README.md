## Usage

### Basic Usage

4. **Effects are created automatically** on both caster and targets
5. **At the start of each turn**, players with sustained spells will see a reminder dialog
6. **Use the sustain dialog** to choose which spells to maintain

### Sustain Macro
- A sustain macro is automatically added to player hotbars
- Click the macro to manually open the sustain dialog
- Select which spells you want to sustain for the current turn
- Unselected spells will have their effects removed

### Effect Linking
- Caster effects are named: "Sustaining: [Spell Name]"
- Target effects are named: "Sustained by: [Caster Name]"
- Effects are linked - removing one removes the corresponding effect on the other actor

## Compatibility

- **Foundry VTT**: Version 11+ (tested up to v13)
- **System**: Pathfinder 2e only
- **Dependencies**: None (uses core PF2e system features)

## Configuration

This module works out of the box with no configuration required. All settings are handled automatically based on spell traits and targeting.

## Troubleshooting

### Effects Not Being Created
- Ensure the spell has the "sustain" trait in its duration
- Make sure you have targets selected (or the caster will be treated as the target)
- Check that the module is enabled in your world

### Reminders Not Appearing
- Verify you're the owner of the character with sustained spells
- Make sure it's the start of your turn in combat
- Check that you have active sustaining effects

### Multiple Effects
- The module prevents duplicate effects from the same spell
- If you see duplicates, they may be from different castings or heightened versions
